# Non-dimensional equations & dimensionless numbers

Before too long it would be a good idea to get a feeling for the flavour
of these equations which continual rearrangements will not do --- it is
necessary to examine some solutions.

First of all it is a good idea to make some simplifications
based on the kinds of problems we will want to attack. The first thing
to do, as is often the case when developing a model, is to test whether
any of the terms in the equations are negligibly small, or 
dominant. To do this, we are going to need to have some physical
insight into the kinds of problems we are going to solve - for example,
some terms may be negligible for slow moving flow but not if the flow is fast
(but what does *'fast'* really mean ?)

One trick that is very common in fliud dynamics is to re-scale the
equations using units that are in some way *natural* to the problem
we are trying to solve. This helps us to answer the question that
came up a moment ago: if a typical velocity is 1, then *'slow'* is $v \ll 1$
and *'fast'* is when $v \gg 1$.  

Remember that even very rational systems of 
units like the SI system are still arbitrary and based on 
the scale of human experience: a metre is not far off the length of 
a step when we walk, a second is our heartbeat, carry a litre of water
when you go walking. 

We don't need to define and name a whole new system of units any time
we start analysing a new problem, but *the fact that we could do this* suggests
there is a way to consider the scale of a problem independenly to the
underlying character of the way things balance each other as the system 
changes through time. 

What we can do is consider 'typical values' for the independent dimensions of
a system (mass, length, time, temperature, that sort of thing) which
can be used to rescale the standard units. For example, we might rescale all 
lengths by the
size of the system we are studying, $d$ (e.g. mantle thickness or depth of fluid in a
lab tank), time according to the characteristic time for diffusion of
heat over that distnace, and temperature by maximum temperature difference 
we observe at the start.

Consider the fluid motions in a layer of arbitrary depth, $d$. The
fluid is assumed to have constant properties such as viscosity, thermal
expansivity, thermal diffusivity. Small fluctuations in density due to
temperature driven flow. Additional heat is carried (advected) by the
flow from the hot boundary to the cool one whenever the fluid is
moving.
```


Various scalings result, with the new variables indicated using a prime
($'$). 

$$
\begin{array}{llll}
    x = d.x' & \partial / \partial x =  (1/d) \partial / \partial x' & \nabla = (1/d) \nabla '  \\
    t = (d^2/\kappa) t'  &  \partial / \partial t = (\kappa/d^2) \partial / \partial t' & \\
    T = \Delta T T' & & \\
    v = (\kappa / d) v' && \\
    p= p_0 + (\eta \kappa / d^2) p'
\end{array}
$$

where $\nabla p_0 = - g \rho_0$

Substituting for all the existing terms in the Navier-Stokes equation
([\[eq:navstokes\]](#eq:navstokes){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:navstokes"}) using the equation of state for thermally
induced variation in density
([\[eq:state\]](#eq:state){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:state"})
gives:

$$
\frac{\rho_0 \kappa}{d^2} \frac{D}{Dt'} \left( \frac{\kappa}{d} \mathbf{v}' \right) =
                \frac{\eta}{d^2} \acute{\nabla}^2 \left( \frac{\kappa}{d} \mathbf{v}' \right)
                - \frac{\eta \kappa}{d^3}  \acute{\nabla} p' + g \rho_0 \alpha \Delta T T' \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$

Collecting everything together gives

$$
\frac{\rho_0 \kappa^2}{d^3} \frac{D\mathbf{v}'}{Dt'}  =
                \frac{\eta \kappa}{d^3} \acute{\nabla}^2  \mathbf{v}' 
                - \frac{\eta \kappa}{d^3}  \acute{\nabla} p' + g \rho_0 \alpha \Delta T T' \hat{\mathbf{z}}
$$

Divide throughout by $\eta \kappa / d^3$ gives

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{\rho \kappa}{\eta} \frac{D\mathbf{v}'}{Dt'}  & =
                     \acute{\nabla}^2  \mathbf{v}'  -  \acute{\nabla} p' + 
                     \frac{g \rho_0 \alpha \Delta T d^3}{\kappa \eta} T' \hat{\mathbf{z}} \nonumber \\
            \textrm{or}  \;\;\; 
     \frac{1}{{\rm Pr}} \frac{D\mathbf{v}'}{Dt'} & =
                    \acute{\nabla}^2  \mathbf{v}'  -  \acute{\nabla} p' + {\rm Ra} T' \hat{\mathbf{z}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\rm Pr$ is known as the Prandtl number, and $\rm Ra$ is known as the
Rayleigh number; both are non-dimensional numbers. By choosing to scale
the equations (and this is still perfectly general as we haven't forced
any particular choice of scaling yet), we have condensed the different
physical variable quantities into just two numbers. The benefit of this
procedure is that it tells us how different quantities trade off against
one another. For example, we see that if the density doubles, and the
viscosity doubles, then the solution should remain unchanged.

In fact, the main purpose of this particular exercise is about to be
revealed. The value of mantle viscosity is believed to lie somewhere
between $10^{19}$ and $10^{23}$ ${\rm Pa . s}$, the thermal diffusivity
is around $10^{-6}{\rm m}^2{\rm s}^{-1}$, and density around
$3300 {\rm kg . m}^{-3}$. This gives a Prandtl number greater than
$10^{20}$. Typical estimates for the Rayleigh number are between $10^6$
and $10^8$ depending on the supposed depth of convection, and the
uncertain mantle viscosity.

Obviously, the time-dependent term can be neglected for the mantle,
since it is at least twenty orders of magnitude smaller than other terms
in the equations. The benefit of this is that the nasty advection term
for momentum is eliminated -- flow in the mantle is at the opposite
extreme to turbulent flow. The disadvantage is that the equations now
become non-local: changes in the stress field are propogated instantly
from point to point which can make the equations a lot harder to solve.
This can be counter-intuitive but the consequences are important when
considering the dynamic response of the Earth to changes in, for
example, plate configurations.

Incidentally, a third, independent dimensionless number can be derived
for the thermally driven flow equations. This is the Nusselt number

$$ {\rm Nu} = \frac{Q}{k\Delta T} $$

and is the ratio of actual heat transported by fluid motions in the
layer compared to that transported conductively in the absence of fluid
motion.

All other dimensionless quantities for this system can be expressed as
some combination of the Nusselt, Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. The
Prandtl number is a property of the fluid itself -- typical values are:
air, $\sim$1; water, $\sim$ 6; non-conducting fluids $10^3$ or more;
liquid metal, $\sim$0.1. Rayleigh number and Nusselt number are both
properties of the chosen geometry.

## The stream function

For incompressible flows in two dimensions it can be very convenient to
work with the stream-function -- a scalar quantity which defines the
flow everywhere. 
The stream function is the scalar quantity,$\psi$, which satisfies

$$
    v_1 = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2} \mbox{\hspace{1cm}}
                        v_2 = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1}
                    \label{eq:strmfn}
$$ 

so that, automatically,

$$
    \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_2} = 0
$$

Importantly, computing the following 

$$
(\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \psi = 
                        v_1 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1} +    
                        v_2 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2} = 
                        \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1} -
                        \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_1} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x_2} = 0
$$

tells us that $\psi$ does not change due to advection -- in other words,
contours of constant $\psi$ are streamlines of the fluid.

Provided we limit ourselves to the xy plane, it is possible to think of
equation ([\[eq:strmfn\]](#eq:strmfn){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:strmfn"}) as

$$
\mathbf{v} = \nabla \times (\psi \hat{\mathbf{k}})
$$

This form can be used to write down the 2D axisymetric version of
equation ([\[eq:strmfn\]](#eq:strmfn){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:strmfn"}) 

$$
\begin{aligned}
                    u_r = -\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta} & & 
                    u_\theta = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}
\end{aligned}
$$ 
            
which automatically satisfies the
incompressibility condition in plane polar coordinates
$$
\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(ru_r) + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial u_\theta}{\partial \theta} = 0
$$

## Vorticity

Vorticity is defined by
$$\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla \times \mathbf{v}$$

In 2D, the vorticity can be regarded as a scalar as it has only one
component which lies out of the plane of the flow.

$$\omega = \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x_1} -
         \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x_2}$$ 
         
which is also exactly equal
to twice the local measure of the spin in the fluid. Local here means
that it applies to an infinitessimal region around the sample point but
not to the fluid as a whole.

This concept is most useful in the context of invicid flow where
vorticity is conserved within the bulk of the fluid provided the fluid
is subject to only conservative forces -- that is ones which can be
described as the gradient of a single-valued potential.

In the context of viscous flow, the viscous effects acts cause diffusion
of vorticity, and in our context, the fact that buoyancy forces result
from to (irreversible) heat transport means that vorticity has sources.
Taking the curl of the Navier-Stokes equation, and substituting for the
vorticity where possible gives

$$\frac{1}{\rm Pr} \left( \frac{D \boldsymbol{\omega}}{D t} - 
                (\boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v} \right) = 
                    \eta \nabla ^2 \boldsymbol{\omega} + {\rm Ra} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1}
$$

The pressure drops out because
$\nabla \times \nabla P = 0 \mbox{\hspace{0.5cm}} \forall P$.

## Stream-function, vorticity and the biharmonic equation

In the context of highly viscous fluids in 2D, the vorticity equation is

$$\nabla ^2 \omega = - Ra \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1}
\label{eq:vorteqn}
$$ 
                
and, by considering the curl of
$(-\partial \psi / \partial x_2, \partial \psi / \partial x_1, 0)$ the
stream function can be written 

$$\nabla ^2 \psi = \omega
                \label{eq:psivort}
$$

This form is useful from a computational point of view because it is
relatively easy to solve the Laplacian, and the code can be reused for
each application of the operator. The Laplacian is also used for thermal
diffusion -- one subroutine for three different bits of physics which is
elegant in itself if nothing else.

The biharmonic operator is defined as

$$\nabla^4 \equiv \nabla^2 ( \nabla ^2) \equiv 
                    \left( \frac{\partial ^4}{\partial x_1^4} + 
                    \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_1^2} \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_2^2} +
                    \frac{\partial ^4}{\partial x_2^4} \right)$$ 
                    
The latter form being the representation in Cartesian coordinates.

Using this form, it is easy to show that equations
([\[eq:vorteqn\]](#eq:vorteqn){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:vorteqn"}) and
([\[eq:psivort\]](#eq:psivort){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:psivort"}) can be combined to give

$$\nabla^4 \psi = -{\rm Ra} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_1}
                \label{eq:biharm}
$$

## Poloidal/Toroidal velocity decomposition

The stream-function / vorticity form we have just used is a
simplification of the more general case of the poloidal / toroidal
velocity decomposition which turns out to be useful when we want to understand
the balance of different contributions to the governing equation.

We can make a Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity vector field:

$$\mathbf{u} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \mathbf{A}$$

Then for an incompressible flow, since $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$,
$$\mathbf{u} = \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \label{eq:curlA}$$

Now suppose there is some direction ($\hat{\mathbf{z}}$) which we expect
to be physically favoured in the solutions, we can rewrite
[\[eq:curlA\]](#eq:curlA){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:curlA"} as

$$\mathbf{u} = \textcolor[rgb]{0.7,0.0,0.0}{\nabla \times(\Psi \hat{\mathbf{z}})} + 
                 \textcolor[rgb]{0.0,0.0,0.7}{ \nabla \times\nabla \times(\Phi \hat{\mathbf{z}})}
    \label{eq:poltor}$$

Where the first term on the right is the
[Toroidal]{style="color: 0.7,0.0,0.0"} part of the flow, and the second
term is the [ Poloidal]{style="color: 0.0,0.0,0.7"} part. Why is this
useful ? Let's substitute
([\[eq:poltor\]](#eq:poltor){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:poltor"}) into the Stokes' equation for a constant
viscosity fluid

$$\eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} - \nabla p = g \rho \hat{\mathbf{z}} 
    \label{eq:cvstokes}$$ 
    
where $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ is the vertical unit
vector (defined by the direction of gravity) and is clearly the one
identifiable special direction, then equate coefficients in the
$\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ direction, and using the following results:

$$\hat{\mathbf{z}} \cdot \nabla \times \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} =
        - \nabla^2 \nabla_h^2\Psi$$

$$\hat{\mathbf{z}} \cdot \nabla \times \nabla \times \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = 
          \nabla^2 \nabla^2 \nabla_h^2\Phi$$

where

$$\nabla_h = \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, 0 \right)$$

is a gradient operator limited to the plane perpendicular to the special
direction, $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$.

If we first take the curl of
([\[eq:cvstokes\]](#eq:cvstokes){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:cvstokes"}), and look at the $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ direction,

$$\hat{\mathbf{z}} \cdot \eta \nabla \times \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = 
        -\eta \nabla^2 \nabla_h^2\Psi = 
        \hat{\mathbf{z}} \cdot \left( g \nabla \times \left( \rho \hat{\mathbf{z}}\right)\right) = 0
$$

we see that there is no contribution of the toroidal velocity field to
the force balance. This balance occurs entirely through the poloidal
part of the velocity field. If we take the curl twice and, once again,
look at the $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ direction:

$$\hat{\mathbf{z}} \cdot \eta \nabla \times \nabla \times \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = 
        \eta \nabla^2 \nabla^2 \nabla_h^2 \Phi = 
        \hat{\mathbf{z}} \cdot g \nabla \times \nabla \times \left( \rho \hat{\mathbf{z}}\right) = 
         \nabla_h^2 (\rho g)$$

Which is the 3D equivalent of the biharmonic equation that we derived
above.

Note: if the viscosity varies in the $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ direction, then
this same decoupling still applies: bouyancy forces do not drive any
toroidal flow. Lateral variations in viscosity (perpendicular to
$\hat{\mathbf{z}}$) couple the buoyancy to toroidal motion. This result
is general in that it applies to the spherical geometry equally well
assuming the radial direction (of gravity) to be special.


## Sample solutions

A number of related solutions exist to problems such as unstable layering
breaking down, buckling of viscous layers and rebound of topography when 
surface loading changes. 

### Rayleigh-Taylor Instability & Diapirism


```{figure} Diagrams/diapirs.png
---
width: 450px
name: rayleigh-taylor
---
Salt diapirs result when a buried layer of salt(a,b) becomes
convectively unstable and rises through the overlying sediment layers
(c,d). The idealized geometry for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
problem is outlined in the lower
diagram
```



Diapirism is the buoyant upwelling of rock which is lighter than its
surroundings. This can include mantle plumes and other purely thermal
phenomena but it often applied to compositionally distinct rock masses
such as melts infiltrating the crust (in the Archean) or salt rising
through denser sediments.

Salt layers may result from the evaporation of seawater. If subsequent
sedimentation covers the salt, a gravitionally unstable configuration
results with heavier material (sediments) on top of light material
(salt). The rheology of salt is distinctly non-linear and also sensitive
to temperature. Once buried, the increased temperature of the salt layer
causes its viscosity to decrease to the point where instabilities can
grow. Note, since there is always a strong density contrast between the
two rock types, the critical Rayleigh number argument does not apply --
this situation is always unstable, but instabilities can only grow at a
reasonable rate once the salt has become weak.


The geometry is outlined above in Figure (
[2](#fig:raytay){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:raytay"}). We
suppose initially that the surface is slightly perturbed with a form of

$$w_m = w_{m0} \cos kx$$

where $k$ is the wavenumber, $k=2\pi / \lambda$, $\lambda$ being the
wavelength of the disturbance. We assume that the magnitude of the
disturbance is always much smaller than the wavelength.

The problem is easiest to solve if we deal with the biharmonic equation
for the stream function. Experience leads us to try to separate
variables and look for solutions of the form

$$\psi = \left( A \sin kx + B \cos kx \right ) Y(y)$$

where the function $Y$ is to be determined. The form we have chosen for
$w_m$ in fact means $A=1,B=0$ which we can assume from now on to
simplify the algebra.

Substituting the trial solution for $\psi$ into the biharmonic equation
gives 

$$\frac{d^4 Y}{d y^4} -2k^2 \frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} +k^4 Y = 0$$

which has solutions of the form 

$$Y = A \exp(m y)$$ 

where $A$ is an arbitrary constant. Subtituting gives us an equation for $m$

$$m^4 - 2 k^2 m^2 + k^4 = (m^2 - k^2)^2 = 0
            \label{eq:diapaux}$$ or $$m = \pm k$$

Because we have degenerate eigenvalues (i.e. of the four possible
solutions to the auxilliary equation
([\[eq:diapaux\]](#eq:diapaux){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:diapaux"}), 
two pairs are equal) we need to extend the
form of the solution to 

$$Y = (By+A) \exp(m y)$$ 

to give the general
form of the solution in this situation to be 

$$\begin{aligned}
            \psi &= \sin kx \left( A e^{-ky} + B y e^{-ky} + C e^{ky} + D y e^{ky} \right)
            \label{eq:biharmsoln1} \\
        \mathrm{or, equivalently}
            \psi &= \sin kx \left( A_1 \cosh ky + B_1 \sinh ky + C_1 y \cosh ky + D_1 y \sinh ky  \right)
            \label{eq:biharmsoln2} 
\end{aligned}$$

This equation applies in each of the layers separately. We therefore
need to find two sets of constants $\{A_1,B_1,C_1,D_1\}$ and
$\{A_2,B_2,C_3,D_4\}$ by the application of suitable boundary
conditions. These are known in terms of the velocities in each layer,
$\mathbf{v}_1 = \mathbf{i} u_1 +\mathbf{j} v_1$ and
$\mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{i} u_2 +\mathbf{j} v_2$: 

$$\begin{aligned}
                u_1 = v_1 &= 0 \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = -b \\
                u_2 = v_2 &= 0 \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = b 
\end{aligned}$$

together with a continuity condition across the interface (which we
assume is imperceptibly deformed

$$u_1 = u_2  \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} and \hspace{1cm}} 
                v_1 = v_2 \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = 0$$

The shear stress ($\sigma_{xy}$) should also be continuous across the
interface, which, if we assume equal viscosities, gives

$$\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial x} =
    \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial v_2}{\partial x} \mathrm{\hspace{1cm} on \hspace{1cm}} y = 0
$$

and, to simplify matters, if the velocity is continuous across $y=0$
then any velocity derivatives in the $x$ direction evaluated at $y=0$
will also be continuous (i.e.
$\partial v_2 / \partial x = \partial v_1 / \partial x$).

The expressions for velocity in terms of the solution
([\[eq:biharmsoln2\]](#eq:biharmsoln2){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:biharmsoln2"}) are

$$\begin{aligned}
    u  = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} & = -\sin kx \left( 
                    (A_1 k + D_1 + C_1 k y) \sinh ky + (B_1 k + C_1 + D_1 ky) \cosh ky  \right) \\
    v  = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} & = k \cos kx \left( 
                    (A_1 +C_1 y)\cosh ky + (B_1 +D_1 y)  \sinh ky   \right)
\end{aligned}$$

From here to the solution requires much tedious rearrangement, and the
usual argument based on the arbitrary choice of wavenumber $k$ but we
finally arrive at 

$$\begin{gathered}
            \psi_1 = A_1 \sin kx \cosh ky + \\
                            A_1 \sin kx \left[  
                                \frac{y}{k b^2} \tanh kb \sinh ky + 
                                        \left( \frac{y}{b} \cosh ky    \frac{1}{kb} \sinh ky \right) \cdot 
                                        \left( \frac{1}{kb} + 
                                        \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} \right) \right] \times \\
                            \left[ \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} - \frac{1}{(b^2k^2} \tanh bk \right] ^{-1}   
            \label{eq:raytays1}             
\end{gathered}$$ 
        
The stream function for the lower layer is
found by replacing $y$ with $-y$ in this equation. This is already a
relatively nasty expression, but we haven't finished since the constant
$A_1$ remains. This occurs because we have so far considered the form of
flows which satisfy all the boundary conditions but have not yet
considered what drives the flow in each layer.

To eliminate $A_1$, we have to consider the physical scales inherent in
the problem itself. We are interested (primarily) in the behaviour of
the interface which moves with a velocity $\partial w / \partial t$. As
we are working with small deflections of the interface,

$$\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = \left. v \right|_{y=0}$$

The restoring force for a stable layering is proportional to the
excess density when a fluid element is displaced across the
boundary
```



Consider what happens when the fluid above the interface is lighter than
the fluid below -- this situation is stable so we expect the layering to
be preserved, and if the interface is disturbed the disturbance to
decay. This implies that there must be a restoring force acting on an
element of fluid which is somehow displaced across the boundary at $y=0$
(Figure [3](#fig:raytay2){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:raytay2"}).

This restoring force is due to the density difference between the
displaced material and the layer in which it finds itself. The
expression for the force is exactly that from Archimedes principle which
explains how a boat can float (only in the opposite direction)

$$\left. F_2 \right|_{y=0} = \delta x g w (\rho_2 - \rho_1)$$ 

which can
be expressed as a normal stress difference (assumed to apply, once
again, at the boundary). The viscous component of the normal stress
turns out to be zero -- proven by evaluating $\partial v / \partial y$
at $y=0$ using the expression for $\phi$ in equation
([\[eq:raytays1\]](#eq:raytays1){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:raytays1"}). Thus the restoring stress is purely pressure

$$\left. P_2 \right|_{y=0} = g w (\rho_2 - \rho_1)$$

The pressure in terms of the solution (so far) for $\psi$ is found from
the equation of motion in the horizontal direction (substituting the
stream function formulation) and is then equated to the restoring
pressure above. 

$$(\rho_1-\rho_2) g w = -\frac{4 \eta k A_1}{b} \cos kx 
    \left(\frac{1}{kb} + \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} \right) \cdot
    \left(   \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} - \frac{1}{(b^2k^2} \tanh bk \right)^{-1}

which allows us to substitute for $A_1$ in our expression for
$\partial w / \partial t$ above. Since $A_1$ is independent of $t$, we
can see that the solution for $w$ will be of a growing or decaying
exponential form with growth/decay constant coming from the argument
above. 

$$w(t) = w_0 \exp((t-t_0)/\tau)$$ 

where

$$\tau = \frac{4 \eta}{(\rho_1-\rho_2) g b} 
        \left( \frac{1}{kb} + \frac{1}{\sinh bk \cosh bk} \right) \cdot
        \left(   \frac{1}{k^2b^2} \tanh kb - \frac{1}{\sinh kb \cosh kb}     \right)^{-1}
$$


So, finally, an answer -- the rate at which instabilities on the
interface between two layers will grow (or shrink) which depends on
viscosity, layer depth and density differences, together with the
geometrical consideration of the layer thicknesses.

A stable layering results from light fluid resting on heavy fluid; a
heavy fluid resting on a light fluid is always unstable (no critical
Rayleigh number applies) although the growth rate can be so small that
no deformation occurs in practice. The growth rate is also dependent on
wavenumber. There is a minimum in the growth time as a function of
dimensional wavenumber which occurs at $k b = 2.4$, so instabilities
close to this wavenumber are expected to grow first and dominate.

Remember that this derivation is simplified for fluids of equal
viscosity, and layers of identical depth. Remember also that the
solution is for infinitessimal deformations of the interface. If the
deformation grows then the approximations of small deformation no longer
hold. This gives a clue as to how difficulties dealing with the
advection term of the transport equations arise.

At some point it becomes impossible to obtain meaningful results without
computer simulation. However, plenty of further work has already been
done on this area for non-linear fluids, temperature dependent viscosity
&c and the solutions are predictably long and tedious to read, much less
solve. When the viscosity is not constant, the use of a stream function
notation is not particularly helpful as the biharmonic form no longer
appears.

The methodology used here is instructive, as it can be used in a number
of different applications to related areas. The equations are similar,
the boundary conditions different.

### Post-Glacial Rebound

The relaxation of the Earth's surface after removal of an ice load.
```


In the postglacial rebound problem, consider a viscous half space with
an imposed topography at $t=0$. The ice load is removed at $t=0$ and the
interface relaxes back to its original flat state.

This can be studied one wavenumber at a time --- computing a decay rate
for each component of the topography. The intial loading is computed
from the fourier transform of the ice bottom topography.

The system is similar to that of the diapirs except that the loading is
now applied to one surface rather than the interface between two fluids.

### Phase Changes in the mantle

A different interface problem is that of mantle phase changes. Here a
bouyancy anomaly results if the phase change boundary is distorted. This
can result from advection normal to the boundary bringing cooler or
warmer material across the boundary.

The buoyancy balance argument used above can be recycled here to
determine a scaling for the ability of plumes/downwellings to cross the
phase boundary.

### Kernels for Surface Observables

The solution method used for the Rayleigh Taylor problem can also be
used in determining spectral Green's functions for mantle flow in
response to thermal perturbations. This is a particularly abstract
application of the identical theory.

## Folding of Layered (Viscous) Medium

Instability in a thin, viscous layer compressed from both ends.
```

If a thin viscous layer is compressed from one end then it may develop
buckling instabilities in which velocities grow perpendicular to the
plane of the layer.

If the layer is embedded between two semi-infinite layers of viscous
fluid with viscosity much smaller than the viscosity of the layer, then
Biot theory tells us the wavelength of the initial buckling instability,
and the rate at which it grows.

The fold geometry evolves as 

$$w=w_m \cos(kx) e^{\frac{t}{\tau_a}}$$

where

$$\tau_a = \frac{1}{\bar{P}}\left[ \frac{4 \eta_0}{k} + \frac{\eta_1 h^3}{3k^2} \right]$$

and the fastest growing wavenumber is

$$k = \frac{6}{h}\left( \frac{\eta_1}{\eta_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}$$

For large deformations we eventually must resort to numerical
simulation.

## Gravity Currents

A gravity current is the spreading of a dense fluid under its own
weight across a horizontal surface (or a buoyant fluid under a surface).

```



Gravity currents can occur when a viscous fluid flows under its own
weight as shown in Figure [6](#fig:gcurr1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:gcurr1"}.

We assume that the fluid has constant viscosity, $\eta$ and that the
length of the current is considerably greater than its height. The fluid
is embedded in a low viscosity medium of density $\rho-\Delta \rho$
where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid itself.

The force balance is between buoyancy and viscosity. The assumptions of
geometry allow us to simplify the Stokes equation by assuming horizontal
pressure gradients due to the surface slope drive the flow.

$$\nabla p = \eta\nabla^2 u \approx   g \Delta \rho \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}$$

We assume near-zero shear stress at the top of the current to give

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} (x,h,t) = 0$$ 

and zero velocity at the
base of the current. Hence

$$u(x,z,t) = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{g \Delta \rho}{\eta} \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}  z(2h-z)$$

Continuity integrated over depth implies

$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \int_0^h u dz = 0$$

Combining these equations gives

$$\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} -\frac{1}{3} \frac{g \Delta \rho}{\eta} 
                     \frac{\partial }{\partial x}  \left( h^3 \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \right) = 0$$

Finally, a global constraint fixes the total amount of fluid at any
given time 

$$\int_0^{x_N(t)} h(x,t)dx = qt^\alpha$$ 

The latter term
being a fluid source at the origin, and $x_{N(t)}$ the location of the
front of the current. A similarity variable is the key to solving this problem:

$$\nu = \left( \frac{1}{3} g\Delta \rho q^3 / \eta \right)^{-\frac{1}{5}} x t^{-(3\alpha +1) / 5}$$

giving a solution of the form

$$h(x,t) = \nu_N^{2/3} (3q^2 \eta / (g\Delta\rho))^{1/5} t^{(2\alpha -1) / 5} \phi(\nu/\nu_N)$$

where $\nu_N$ is the value of $\nu$ at $x=x_N(t)$. Substituting into the
equation for $\partial h / \partial t$ we find that $\phi(\nu/\nu_N)$
satisfies

$$\phi({\nu}/{\nu_N}) = \left[ \frac{3}{5}(3\alpha+1)\right]^{\frac{1}{3}}
                \left(1-\frac{\nu}{\nu_N} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \left[
                1 - \frac{3\alpha-4}{24(3\alpha+1)}\left(1-\frac{\nu}{\nu_N} \right) + O \left(1-\frac{\nu}{\nu_N} \right)^2
                \right]$$ 
                
Which has an analytic solution if $\alpha=0$
(only constant sources or sinks) 

$$\begin{split} 
            \phi({\nu}/{\nu_N}) &= \left( \frac{3}{10}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} 
            \left( 1-\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_N}\right)^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}  \\                     
        \nu_N &= \left[ \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{3}{10}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}  \pi^{\frac{1}{2}}
    \Gamma (1/3) / \Gamma (5/6) \right]^{-\frac{3}{5}} = 1.411
\end{split}
$$ 
            
For all other values of $\alpha$ numerical
integration schemes must be used for $\phi$.

It is also possible to obtain solutions if axisymmetric geometry is
used.
