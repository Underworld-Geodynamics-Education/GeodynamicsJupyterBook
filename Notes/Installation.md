# Installation / Environment

The issue here is what to do when different chapters of the book need different jupyter environments

The strategy is:
  - install nb_conda_kernels in "main" environment (the one that we will launch jupyter from)
  - install other environments - they do not need jupyter but the do need the relevant kernel
  - standard naming scheme so that notebooks saved / created on one machine pick up the correct kernel on the hub


## Local environment



## Github actions



## Jupyterhub environment

Kernels / kernel-name specifications
